               <h2>About Me</h2>
               
               <p>Time management is something that is important to me and it’s something that I am always
adapting and learning from. It allows me to be effective with my responsibilities professionally
and personally. I have a 5 year plan to pursue my education in Informative Technology through
various skill trade certifications at San Diego College of Continuing Education. After I achieve
my certification goal I will transfer my credits to college and pursue an associates in I.t.</p>
          
          <p>As an employee I like to do everything with determination. I’m open to critical feedback because
I like to improve my skills. The thing that sets me apart from others applications is my soft skills
in communication. One example is my ambition as a student, I am going to school where I have
little to no experience in the subject. I ask questions when I don’t understand something, I listen
and communicate my understanding with simple gestures. Another example, as a manager I
have to be aware of the company’s needs and implement an agenda and lead others to the same
goal. All of these tasks are not easy but with my willingness I am able to complete jobs or tasks as
requested.</p>
